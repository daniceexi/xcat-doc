Getting Started
===============

xCAT is an open source project hosted on `SourceForge <http://sourceforge.net/p/xcat/wiki/Main_Page/>`_ and mirrored on `GitHub <https://github.com/xcat2/xcat-core/>`_.

We are looking at moving over to be primarily hosted on GitHub

xCAT can be downloaded from the following page: `Download xCAT <http://sourceforge.net/p/xcat/wiki/Download_xCAT/>`_
There are three versions to choose from:

* Latest Stable - the latest release of xCAT that has been completly tested
* Latest Snapshot - the latest build of the current release, contains bug fixes but not completely tested
* Development - the development release contains new functions/features planned for the next release
