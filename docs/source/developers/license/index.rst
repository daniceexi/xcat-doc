Contributor and Maintainer Agreements
=====================================

xCAT 2 is licensed under the `Eclipse Public License <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/eclipse-1.0.php>`_.   All contributions to xCAT must be licensed to xCAT pursuant to the referenced :ref:`xcat-contributor-license-label`.

Contributor
-----------

We welcome new developers willing to contribute to the xCAT code to make it better. In order to do that, you need to:

  * License your contribution(s) pursuant to the :ref:`xcat-contributor-license-label`.
  * Decide if you want to sign the contributor license agreement as an individual or as a corporate. The **individual license agreement** allows the individual contributor to submit contributions to the xCAT community.  The **corporate contributor license agreement** allows an entity (the "Corporation") to submit contributions to the xCAT Community. 
  * Print the :ref:`xcat-individual-contributor-license-label` or :ref:`xcat-corporate-contributor-license-label`, fill it out, sign it, scan it, then email it to: xcat-legal@lists.sourceforge.net.
  * After submitting the signed license agreement, you can fork the xcat project, make changes, and submit pull requests so they can be integrated into the xCAT code stream.
  * If you are an experienced xCAT user and plan to contribute to the xCAT code regularly, request to become a Maintainer with Git push access. See the section below for details.

Maintainer
----------

If you are an experienced xCAT user and plan to contribute to the xCAT code regularly, you can request to become an xCAT Maintainer (which includes git push access) by posting to the xCAT mailing list.

If you are approved to become an xCAT maintainer, you must print the agreement :download:`xCAT Maintainer License Agreement <xcat-project-maintainer-agreement.pdf>`, fill it out and sign it, scan it in, and email it to xcat-legal@lists.sourceforge.net .

The roles and responsibilities of the maintainers are:

  * set the direction for the xCAT project, including architectural and design decisions
  * commit code (new function or fixes) to the xCAT GitHub repository (either their own code, or on behalf of another contributor - see below)
  * review requests for xCAT members to become maintainers (All such requests will be subject to a vote of current maintainers. Consensus of current maintainers is required for approval.)
  * review and help resolve technical concerns or problems regarding the project

All decisions by the maintainers are made by consensus.

When a maintainer pushes code to the xCAT GitHub repository for another contributor (i.e. **not** your own code), they must:

  * Require that each code contributor sign the :ref:`xcat-individual-contributor-license-label` or :ref:`xcat-corporate-contributor-license-label` and email it to xcat-legal@lists.sourceforge.net .
  * Require that all code be contributed under the EPL.
  * Create a log entry with intellectual property information about the contribution & contributor. Each log entry should contain the information below, and should be posted to xcat-legal@lists.sourceforge.net: ::

        Maintainer Name:  (the person who committed the code to the xCAT GitHub repository)
        Maintainer Sourceforge Id:
        Contributor Name:  (the author of the code)
        Contributor's Organization or Employer (if the contribution was made on the organization's/employer's behalf):
        Contributor Sourceforge Id:
        GitHub  Id of This Code PUSH:
        Date Code was Committed:
        Purpose/Description of New/Changed Code:
        Approximate Number of Lines of Code Added/Changed/Removed by This Commit:
        Additional Authors of the Contributed Code:
