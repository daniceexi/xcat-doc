xCAT stands for E\ **x**\ treme **C**\ loud/\ **C**\ luster **A**\ dministration **T**\ oolkit.

xCAT offers complete management of clouds, clusters (HPC), grids, datacenters, 
renderfarms, online gaming infrastructure, and whatever tomorrows next buzzword may be.

xCAT enables the administrator to:

    #.  provision operating systems on physical (“bare metal”) or virtual machines.
    #.  provision machines using scripted install, stateless, statelite, iSCSI, or cloning.
    #.  remotely manage systems (lights out management, remote console support, distributed shell support).
    #.  quickly configure and control management nodes services: dns, http, dhcp, tftp, nfs, etc.

**xCAT** is an open source project hosted on `SourceForge <http://sourceforge.net/p/xcat/wiki/Main_Page/>`_ and currently mirrored on `GitHub <https://github.com/xcat2/xcat-core/>`_.  (We hope to be natively hosted on GitHub in the near future)

Enjoy!
