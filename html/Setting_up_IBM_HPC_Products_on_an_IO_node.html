<p>The xCAT IBM HPC Integration function also provides instructions and sample files for setting up an I/O node in your xCAT cluster.</p>
<p>In an HPC cluster, I/O nodes play a different role from compute nodes. Typically, the I/O nodes are dedicated, over which the rest of the cluster stripes data transfers to achieve the required parallel I/O bandwidth. The underlying storage systems can be either direct-attached storage connected to cluster I/O nodes via FibreChannel or network-attached storage (NAS) accessed by I/O nodes over a storage network.</p>
<p>These instructions address how to set up IBM GPFS product on an I/O node. It assumes that you have already purchased your GPFS product, have the Linux rpms available, and are familiar with the http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/clresctr/vxrx/topic/com.ibm.cluster.gpfs.doc/gpfsbooks.html GPFS documentation.</p>
<p>If you need other products installed on your I/O nodes, you can combine the installp bundle files or the pkglist files as needed.</p>
<p>These instructions are based on GPFS 3.4.5. If you are using a different version of GPFS product, you may need to make adjustments to the information provided here.</p>
<p>This support will use xCAT to do basic GPFS product installation and configuration into an I/O node. The support is provided as sample files only. Before using this support, you should review all files first and modify them to conform to your environment.</p>
<p>Since the I/O nodes install the same base HPC packages and the same GPFS product that are installed on compute nodes. So we can refer to the GPFS setup steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Setting_up_GPFS_in_a_Statelite_or_Stateless_Cluster]</li>
<li>[Setting_up_GPFS_in_a_Stateful_Cluster]</li>
