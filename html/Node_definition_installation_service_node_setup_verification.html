<p>The verification for node (Include service node or compute node) definitioin and status after the installation/netboot is very important for user to know that the node is ready for installation or has been installed succeeded. This mini-design lists the items that should be checked before and after the installation for a node. The check activity should be implemented in a perl script and called by the nodecheck command.</p>
<p>Verify the node definition before the install/netboot: * dns: (the name resolution for the node, short name) * dhcp: (has correct dhcpd.conf and correct section in the lease file) * conserver: The node has a section in the /etc/conserver.cf * The hcp is pingable * Has correct bootloader file for the node (yaboot, pxelinux, xnba) * The correct bootloader configuration file has been created * Check the attributes: noderes.netboot, noderes.tftpserver,noderes.nfsserver,noderes.installnic,noderes.xcatmaster * Diskfull :* autoyast/kickstart configuration file has been created :* copycds has been run for the specific os :* The kernel, initrd have been copied to correct location * Diskless :* The specific osimage has been created :* The kernel and osimage has been copied to the correct location * Statelite :* The specific osimage has been created :* The kernel and osimage has been copied to the correct location :* The statelite,litefile,litetree table</p>
<ul>
<li>passwd table has correct entries (omapi,xcat,system)</li>
<li>The password in the ppchcp,ppcdirect,ipmi tables</li>
<li>Display a configuration after the check :* Display: node name, node IP,mac address, os, profile, path of autoyast/kickstart configuration file, kernel parameters, :* List the postscripts, postbootscripts which will be run during the installation :* List the syncfile, pkglist, otherpkgs.pkglist which will be run for the node</li>
<li>virtualization node ...</li>
</ul>
<p>Verify the node status after the install/netboot: * dns: the node name of MN/SN can be resolved from the compute node * Can ssh to the node without passwd from the MN/SN * The node status is correct * The files in the synclist have been synced to the node * The pkgs in the otherpkgs.pkglist have been synced to the node</p>
<p>Service node specific: * The xCAT and dependency packages have been installed (xCATsn instead of xCAT) * All the processes of xCAT have been started * The database has been configured correctly. (/etc/xcat/cfgloc) * The credentials have been gotten from MN. Should check the compatibility with the ones on MN. * .ssh/ has correct configuration so that MN can ssh to SN without password * The syslog has been redirected to the MN * The service like tftp,nfs,http... have been started base on the definition of the service node. (servicenode table) * The installation resource from the management node (/install mount from MN?) * Has correct files in /install/postscripts</p>
