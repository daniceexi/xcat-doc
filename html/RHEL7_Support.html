<p>This is a general guideline to support a new Linux distribution in xCAT.</p>
<p>An typical work flow of xCAT to support a newly released linux distribution is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>setup a xCAT mgt server on RHEL7, make sure the following points, fix the problems if any:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>successfully install all the xCAT core packages with xCAT dependency packages and OS shipped packages</p></li>
<li><p>successfully configure xCAT management node and start xCAT service</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>provision xCAT computer node with the RHEL7 iso, make sure the following points, fix the problems if any:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>successfully copy in the RHEL7 iso with command &quot;copycds&quot;. for the Linux distributions belonging to or derived from the redhat-family, such as centos, rh,fedora,sl, add the serial No in the .discinfo file in the iso, usually the 1st line, into the %distnames of perl-xCAT.pm</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>successfully provision RHEL7 computer nodes with the diskful,statelite and stateless mode. in the past experience, &quot;genimage&quot; needs special attention.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>After the above 2 steps has been passed on the required platform(system P/X), transfer the test task to FVT<br />Other Design Considerations</li>
</ol>
<p>Other Design Considerations • Required reviewers: xCAT ALL • Required approvers: Li Guang Cheng • Database schema changes: N/A • Affect on other components: N/A • External interface changes, documentation, and usability issues: Yes • Packaging, installation, dependencies: N/A • Portability and platforms (HW/SW) supported: Tuleta, RHEL 7. • Performance and scaling considerations: N/A • Migration and coexistence: Yes • Serviceability: N/A • Security: N/A • NLS and accessibility: N/A • Invention protection: N/A</p>
