<p><strong>Note: this document is continually under construction, since the ports that xCAT uses change as features are added.</strong></p>
<h2 id="xcat-port-usage"><a href="#TOC">xCAT Port Usage</a></h2>
<p>The following table lists the ports that must be open between the xCAT management node and the nodes it manages, unless otherwise noted. The xCAT service nodes use the same ports as the management node. A service (or protocol) applies to both AIX and Linux, unless stated otherwise. Service names are typical strings that appear in the /etc/services file, or in firewall/IP filtering logs. Local customization of the /etc/services files, daemon configuration options, like overriding the default port number, and differences in software source implementations, may yield other service information results.</p>
<p>The category of required or optional is difficult to fill in because depending on what function you are running what might be listed here as optional, may actually be required. The Trusted side is behind the firewall, the Non-trusted side is in front of the firewall.</p>

<h3 id="note-1---aix-mount"><a href="#TOC"><strong>Note 1 - AIX mount</strong></a></h3>
<p>On AIX, the mountd port range is usually determined at the time of the mount request. Part of the communication flow within a mount command is to query the remote mountd server and find out what ports it is using. The mountd ports are selected dynamically each time the mountd server is initialized. Therefore, the port numbers will vary from one boot to another, or when mountd is stopped and restarted.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this causes a problem when used through a firewall, as no rule can be defined to handle traffic with a variable primary port. To create a service for mountd (server) traffic that has a fixed port, and one that can be trapped by a rule, you will need to update the /etc/services file on the host that is the target of the mount with new mountd entries for TCP and UDP, where the port numbers are known to be unused (free). The mountd TCP and UDP ports must be different. Any free port number is valid. The mountd must be stopped and started to pick up the new port values.</p>
<p>For example, issuing a mount request on Non-trusted node X, whose target is the Management Server, that is,</p>
<p>mount ms2112:/images /images</p>
<p>would require that the /etc/services file on ms2112 be updated with something similar to the following:</p>
<p>mountd 33333/tcp mountd 33334/udp</p>
<p>For mountd to detect its new port values you must stop and start rpc.mountd. The stopping and starting of mountd takes place on the same host where the /etc/services file mountd updates were made. In the above example, ms2112's mountd is stopped and started. You can verify that mountd is using the new port definitions by issuing the rpcinfo command.</p>
<p>This procedure shows how to change ports used by mountd:</p>
<p>lssrc -s rpc.mountd</p>
<p>Produces output similar to:</p>
<p>Subsystem Group PID Status rpc.mountd nfs 12404 active</p>
<p>rpcinfo -p ms2112 | grep mount</p>
<p>Produces output similar to:</p>
<p>100005 1 udp 37395 mountd 100005 2 udp 37395 mountd 100005 3 udp 37395 mountd 100005 1 tcp 34095 mountd 100005 2 tcp 34095 mountd 100005 3 tcp 34095 mountd</p>
<p>stopsrc -s rpc.mount</p>
<p>Produces output similar to:</p>
<p>0513-044 The rpc.mountd Subsystem was requested to stop.</p>
<p>Update /etc/services with new mountd entries.</p>
<p>Note: Make a backup copy of /etc/services before making changes.</p>
<p>grep mountd /etc/services</p>
<p>Produces output similar to:</p>
<p>mountd 33333/tcp mountd 33334/udp</p>
<p>startsrc -s rpc.mountd</p>
<p>Produces output similar to:</p>
<p>0513-059 The rpc.mountd Subsystem has been started. Subsystem PID is 19536.</p>
<p>rpcinfo -p ms2112 | grep mount</p>
<p>Produces output similar to:</p>
<p>100005 1 udp 33334 mountd 100005 2 udp 33334 mountd 100005 3 udp 33334 mountd 100005 1 tcp 33333 mountd 100005 2 tcp 33333 mountd 100005 3 tcp 33333 mountd</p>
<h3 id="note-2"><a href="#TOC"><strong>Note 2</strong></a></h3>
<p>The rpc-mount service differs from the other service definitions in the following way. There is no associated protocol, because by definition it is UDP based. There is no source port</p>
