<h2 id="granting-users-xcat-privileges-setting-up-a-remote-client"><a href="#TOC">Granting Users xCAT privileges &amp; Setting Up a Remote Client</a></h2>
<p>By default, only root on the management node can run xCAT commands. But xCAT can be configured to allow both non-root users and remote users to run xCAT commands. The steps below will explain how. If you only want non-root local users, you can stop after step 2.</p>
<h2 id="create-ssl-certificate-so-that-user-can-be-authenticated-to-xcat"><a href="#TOC">Create SSL certificate so that user can be authenticated to xCAT</a></h2>
<p>This is done by running the following command on the Management node as root:</p>
<pre><code>/opt/xcat/share/xcat/scripts/setup-local-client.sh &amp;lt;username&amp;gt;</code></pre>
<p>By running this command you'll see SSL certificates created. Enter yes where prompted and take the defaults.</p>
<p>This will create the following files in the $HOME/.xcat directory:</p>
<pre><code>ca.pem
client-cert.pem
client-cred.pem
client-key.pem
client-req.pem</code></pre>
<p>This causes xCAT to recognize this userid, so that it can be specified in the policy table in the next step.</p>
<h3 id="change-the-policy-table-to-allow-the-user-to-run-commands"><a href="#TOC">Change the policy table to allow the user to run commands</a></h3>
<p>For information on the policy table. See man the man the manpage: http://xcat.sourceforge.net/man5/policy.5.html</p>
<p>To give a user all xCAT command privileges, run &quot;tabedit policy&quot;, and add a line:</p>
<pre><code>6,&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;,,,,,,allow,,</code></pre>
<p>where &lt;username&gt; is the name of the user that you are granting privileges to. In the above case, this user can now perform <em>all</em> xCAT commands, including changing the policy table to do things like allow them to become other users, so this should be used with caution.</p>
<p>You may only want to grant users limited access. One example, is that one user may only be allowed to run the nodels command. This can be done as follows:</p>
<pre><code>6,&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;,,nodels,,,,allow</code></pre>
<p>If you want to grant all users the ability to run nodels, add this line:</p>
<pre><code>6.1,*,,nodels,,,,allow</code></pre>
<p>by running</p>
<pre><code>chdef -t policy -o 6.1 name=* commands=nodels rule=allow</code></pre>
<p>Another example is to allow the user to run the rpower command with only the &quot;stat&quot; parameter, and only on certain nodes. (We also use chdef to modify the policy table, as an example of an alternative to tabedit.)</p>
<pre><code># chdef -t policy -o 6.0 name=&amp;lt;username&amp;gt; commands=rpower parameters=stat noderange=h02-h03 rule=allow
# su - &amp;lt;username&amp;gt;
-bash-3.2$ rpower h02 on
Error: Permission denied for request
-bash-3.2$ rpower h02 stat
h02: on
-bash-3.2$ rpower h01 stat
Error: Permission denied for request</code></pre>
<p>For a full explanation of the policy table, refer to the policy man page:</p>
<pre><code>man policy</code></pre>
<h2 id="setup-remote-commands-for-user"><a href="#TOC">Setup remote commands for user</a></h2>
<p>To give a user the ability to run remote commands (xdsh,xdcp,psh,pcp), as the username run:</p>
<pre><code>xdsh &amp;lt;noderange&amp;gt; -K</code></pre>
<p>This will setup the user and root ssh keys for the user under the $HOME/.ssh directory of the user on the nodes. The root ssh keys are needed for the user to run the xCAT commands under the xcatd daemon, where the user will be running as root. Note: the uid for the user should match the uid on the Management Node and a password for the user must have been set on the nodes.</p>
<h2 id="setup-login-node-remote-client"><a href="#TOC">Setup Login Node (remote client)</a></h2>
<p>In some cases, you many not want your non-root user to login to the Management Node, but to use a Login Node and run the xCAT commands from the Login Node.<br />To setup a Linux or AIX Login Node, first install the following rpms:<br />perl-xCAT-*<br />xCAT-client-+</p>
<p>and from dependencies:</p>
<p>perl-IO-Socket-SSL*<br />perl-Net-SSLeay-*<br />perl-DBI-*</p>
<p>When running on the Login Node, the environment variable XCATHOST must be export to the name or address of the Management node and the port for connections (usually 3001).</p>
<pre><code>export XCATHOST=myManagmentServer:3001</code></pre>
<p>The userids and groupids of the non-root users should be kept the same on the Login Node, the Management Node, Service Nodes and compute nodes.</p>
<p>As in the first step, setup the credentials on the Management node by running the /opt/xcat/share/xcat/scripts/setup-local-client.sh &lt;username&gt; command as root. The credentials are placed in $HOME/.xcat directory. These file must be copied to the $HOME/.xcat directory of the username on the Login Node.</p>
<p>As in the second step, setup your policy table on the Managment Node with the permissions that you would like the non-root id to have. Remember, you are giving this id the authority to run the xcat commands as root.</p>
<p>At this time, the id should be able to execute any commands that have been set in the policy table from the Login Node as their userid.</p>
<p>If any remote shell commmands (psh,xdsh) are needed, then you need to follow the step 3.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-mounted-user-home-directory"><a href="#TOC">Setting Up Mounted User Home Directory</a></h2>
<p>This process is to setup the userid's in order to be able to run xcat commands from the login node. Reference: http://xcat.wiki.sourceforge.net/Granting+Users+xCAT+privileges. The additional work to be done here is to setup ssh such that the user can run the xcat commands from a login node to the Management Node , and the user home directory is nfs mounted from the login node on the Management Node and nodes. First, the root admin must define the user and it's group and ensure that the uid and gid are the same across the cluster. It is also desirable to assign a password and distribute this across the cluster. We will be using ssh keys, but if the keys are not there, you can always login with a password.</p>
<p>Since the home directory of all the users will be mounted on the nodes from the login node ( in our case /nfs01). The home directory must be exported as follows: /nfs01 -sec=sys:krb5p:krb5i:krb5:dh,rw. This ensures that only a user can write to their own directory ( not even root). This is required for the ssh keys in $HOME/.ssh to work. The user's home directory must have permission set to 0700 for ssh.</p>
<p>On the Management Node, root must run /opt/xcat/share/xcat/scripts/setup-local-client.sh &lt;user&gt;, for each user. This will generate the needed credentials for the user. Since root cannot write to the $HOME directory of the user, we must put the credentials in a directory where root can write, and then have the user copy them to their $HOME/,xcat directory. So as root: - created /u/xcat directory in a global mounted /u directory ( substitute &quot;home&quot; for &quot;u&quot; for AIX). - for each user, generate the credential and store in this directory under the user name. /opt/xcat/share/xcat/scripts/setup-local-client.sh &lt;user&gt; /u/xcat/&lt;user&gt;</p>
<p>On the login node as root: - chown -R &lt;user&gt;:usr /u/xcat/&lt;user&gt; - mv /u/xcat/&lt;user&gt;/.xcat /u/user/.xcat</p>
<p>Mount the user home directories on the Management Node and nodes. On the Management Node, root must update the policy table to indicate which users are able to run which commands. One way is to just have all users run a subset of xcat commands, like xdsh, xdsh,psh, nodels, lsdef,xcoll,xdshbak, rpower, nodestat, rnetboot, tabdump, sinv,rinv.etc. Make sure that in the site table the attribute &quot;useSSHonAIX&quot;,&quot;yes&quot;, if your logon node or your Management Node is AIX. To setup ssh so the user can run as root under the xcatd daemon, we need the root ssh authorized_key files from the Managment node added to the users authorized_key files. Root needs to copy to the Login node, the /install/postscripts/<em>ssh from the Management node: - mkdir /u/xcat/c906mgrs1/</em>ssh - scp c906mgrs1:/install/postscripts/_ssh/* /u/xcat/c906mgrs1_ssh</p>
<p>Now the user needs to generate their ssh keys on login node:</p>
<p>/usr/bin/ssh-keygen -t rsa1. Hit enter to take defaults on all questions, do not set a passphrase. /usr/bin/ssh-keygen -t rsa . Hit enter to take all defaults. /usr/bin/ssh-keygen -t dsa. Hit enter to take all defaults. You should have public and private keys (identity, rsa,dsa) in $HOME/.ssh Make sure your $HOME directory permission is set to 0700. Make sure you $HOME/.ssh directory permission is set to 0700. cat identity.pub &gt; authorized_keys cat id_rsa.pub &gt; authorized_keys2 cat id_dsa.pub &gt;&gt; authorized_keys2 add roots keys: cat /u/xcat/c906mgrs1_ssh/authorized_keys &gt;&gt; authorized_keys cat /u/xcat/c906mgrs1_ssh/authorized_keys2 &gt;&gt; authorized_keys2 chmod 0600 authorized_keys* At this point on the Login node, the user must &quot;export XCATHOST=Management Node:3001&quot;, to run xCAT commands on the MN. - Added entries to /etc/profile so this is set up for all users. Right now points to Linux mn. Will need to switch to point to AIX mn when we switch modes on the cluster. - Also, users shouuld check their PATH and MANPATH for xCAT directories. These are set in /etc/profile, but many users override these settings in their private .profile files. Run nodels and xdsh &lt;some compute node&gt; date to verify the setup. - Also run 'xdsh &lt;node&gt; -l root date' to verify root xdsh access.</p>
