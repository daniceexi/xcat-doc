<h2 id="the-xcat-rolling-update-support-is-obsolete"><a href="#TOC">THE xCAT ROLLING UPDATE SUPPORT IS OBSOLETE</a></h2>
<p>The xCAT Rolling Update support requires the Tivoli Workload Scheduler LoadLeveler to schedule the nodes for update. LoadLeveler has been superseded by LSF in the IBM HPC Software stack, so this xCAT function is no longer supported.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://sourceforge.net/p/xcat/wiki/XCAT_Documentation/attachment/Official-xcat-doc.png" /><p class="caption"></p>
</div>
<h2 id="overview"><a href="#TOC">Overview</a></h2>
<p>This document provides an overview of the xCAT Rolling Update support available in xCAT 2.6.6 and later releases for AIX and pLinux clusters. This support is available in xCAT 2.5 as beta for AIX Clusters.</p>
<p>The xCAT rolling update support allows you to update the OS image on a subset of cluster nodes at a time, such that the remaining nodes in the cluster can still be running jobs. This process uses the Tivoli Workload Scheduler LoadLeveler to determine node availability and control the update process.</p>
<p>Based on input from the xCAT administrator, LoadLeveler flexible reservations are created for specific sets of nodes, and xCAT will update a set of nodes when its reservation becomes active.</p>
<p>xCAT rollupdate support provides the framework to update sets of nodes in your cluster. Nodes to be updated can be specified in one of two ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>As a list of all nodes to be updated, and the number of nodes to be updated together in one set. This approach can be used for simple updates across your cluster, where there are no special interdependencies between node updates and nodes can be updated in any order as they become available.</li>
<li>As specific update groups, in which the nodes to be updated together are explicitly listed. This approach is for more complex updates in which you wish to have more control over which nodes are updated together, the order of node updates within a group, and which groups of nodes cannot be updated at the same time in order to maintain critical system resources.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both approaches allow you to limit the number of nodes to be updated at any one time, to provide a list of commands that can be run before the nodes in an update group are shut down (prescripts) and a list of commands that can be run after the nodes have been powered off, but before they are rebooted (outofbandcmds).</p>
<p>Prescripts can be useful to notify applications that nodes will be going down, and to move critical services to backup nodes before they are shut down.</p>
<p>Out-of-band commands can be used to perform operations that require the nodes to be powered down, such as firmware updates.</p>
<p>Restrictions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Support for including infrastructure nodes such as Service Nodes and GPFS I/O nodes in update groups is released as &quot;experimental only&quot;. All required function has been coded and unit tested by xCAT development, but this support has not been tested in a formal Functional Verification Test or System Test environment.</li>
<li>For Power 775 clusters, the GPFS I/O nodes and the compute nodes are typically installed as statelite nodes, mounting persistent directories through soft NFS mounts served by their service nodes. While it may be possible that a compute node can continue to operate when its service node goes down, the continued operation of the GPFS I/O nodes and the availability of your GPFS filesystems may be compromised. The xCAT rolling update solution will not be supported for service nodes (which includes firmware updates of CECs in which a service node resides) until a high-availability solution is in place for these clusters, or if you have implemented a cluster solution that allows GPFS filesystems to remain operational when any service node goes down.</li>
<li>For Power 775 clusters, the xCAT rolling update solution cannot be used to update the bulk power code (BPC) firmware on a frame, since this will require taking down an entire frame, and which should only be scheduled during a full maintenance outage.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="prerequisites-for-rolling-update-support"><a href="#TOC">Prerequisites for Rolling Update Support</a></h2>
<p>The following prerequisites must be set up before running the xCAT rolling update support:</p>
<ul>
<li>LoadLeveler must be installed and running on all of the cluster nodes that will be updated. See <a href="Setting_up_the_IBM_HPC_Stack_in_an_xCAT_Cluster">Setting_up_the_IBM_HPC_Stack_in_an_xCAT_Cluster</a> for information on installing and configuring LoadLeveler in an xCAT cluster. It is possible to run updates for some nodes that are not active in LoadLeveler; however to use the full rolling update support, LL should be active. See the stanza input entries for the standard update method with <strong>update_if_down=yes</strong>.</li>
<li>LoadLeveler must be running with the database configuration option, using xCAT's database.</li>
<li>The simplest configuration for using xCAT with LoadLeveler for rolling updates is to configure the LoadLeveler central manager on your xCAT management node.</li>
<li><p>If the xCAT management node is not the LoadLeveler central manager, you must do the following:</p></li>
<li>Set up your LoadLeveler central manager as an xCAT client machine so that it can run the xCAT runrollupdate command. To set up a remote xCAT client, see the xCAT wiki how-to <a href="Granting_Users_xCAT_privileges">Granting Users xCAT privileges &amp; Setting Up a Remote Client</a>. This includes installing the xCAT client and prerequisite rpms, and setting up the correct port communications with the xCAT management node. If your LoadLeveler Central Manager is an xCAT service node, you do not need to do anything special to set up this remote client -- all xCAT service nodes should already be able to run xCAT commands.</li>
<li>Set up network routing so that the xCAT management node and the LoadLeveler central manager can communicate to each other across the interfaces defined to LoadLeveler (i.e. the xCAT MN should be able to ping the LL CM name, and the LL CM should be able to ping the xCAT MN LL machine name).</li>
<li>Install the LoadLeveler scheduler rpm/lpp on your xCAT management node.</li>
<li>Make sure your xCAT management node has your LoadLeveler admin userid and group defined, and that the common home directory for that userid is mounted. Note that if the common home directory is NFS-based, the NFS server must allow root on the xCAT management node to change ownership/permissions in that directory, typically by exporting the directory with options such as &quot;root=&lt;MN&gt;,access=&lt;MN&gt;&quot;, or if this is a closed cluster, simply &quot;root=<em>,access=</em>&quot;.</li>
<li><p>Create a /etc/LoadL.cfg file that is capable of updating the xCAT database:</p>
<p>cat /etc/LoadL.cfg LoadLUserid = &lt;your LL admin userid&gt; LoadLGroupid = &lt;your LL admin group&gt; LoadLDB = xcatdb</p>
<p>Note that in order to run the LoadLeveler database configuration option, you should have already set up ODBC support for LoadLeveler on your xCAT management node.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a LL machine definition for your xCAT management node. If you do not want any LL daemons to run on the MN (recommended), set the LL machine attributes:</p>
<p>SCHEDD_RUNS_HERE=false STARTD_RUNS_HERE=false</p></li>
<li><p>Start the LoadLeveler master daemon on your xCAT management node:</p>
<p>llctl start</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure at least one LoadLeveler schedd machine is set up as a public schedd by setting the LL machine attribute for that machine:</p>
<p>SCHEDD_HOST=true</p></li>
<li>The LoadLeveler userid specified in the xCAT rollupdate input <strong>scheduser</strong> stanza must be authorized to run the xCAT &quot;runrollupdate&quot; command. See the xCAT wiki how-to <a href="Granting_Users_xCAT_privileges">Granting_Users_xCAT_privileges</a> to set this up. This includes creating SSL certificates for the user and changing the xCAT policy table.</li>
<li>Loadleveler settings need to be able to handle flexible reservations. See chapter on <a href="#loadLeveler-settings">LoadLeveler Settings</a> for a listing of additional requirements.</li>
<li>The root userid on the xCAT management node must have LOADL_ADMIN privileges.</li>
<li><p>You have created the new OS image that will be loaded onto the nodes and run all of the necessary xCAT commands such that when the node is rebooted, it will load your updated image.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rollupdate-input-stanza-file"><a href="#TOC">rollupdate Input Stanza File</a></h2>
<p>The input to the xCAT rollupdate command is a stanza file piped through STDIN. xCAT provides sample stanza files in:</p>
<pre><code>/opt/xcat/share/xcat/rollupdate</code></pre>
<p>The rolling update support provides two different methods of specifying nodes to be update: The <strong>updateall</strong> method to update all specified nodes in any order as they become available, and the <strong>standard</strong> method requiring explicit update groups identifying nodes to be updated together. Different stanza keywords apply to these different methods and are noted below.</p>
<p>Stanza input is specified as:</p>
<p><strong>keyword</strong> <strong>=</strong> <strong>value</strong></p>
<p>with one keyword per line. Unless otherwise noted in the descriptions below, if multiple stanza lines are specified for the same keyword, only the FIRST entry will be used and all others will be ignored.</p>
<p>Valid keywords are:</p>
<p>**scheduler = **scheduler</p>
<p>where scheduler is the job scheduler used to submit the rolling update jobs. Currently only &quot;loadleveler&quot; is supported.</p>
<p>**scheduser = **scheduser</p>
<p>where scheduser is the userid with authority to submit scheduler jobs. Note that LoadLeveler does not allow reservation jobs to be submitted by the root userid.</p>
<p>**oldfeature = **feature value</p>
<p>(optional) where feature value is an existing LoadLeveler feature value that is set for the nodes being updated. xCAT will remove this value from the LoadLeveler machine definition after the update has completed.</p>
<p>**newfeature = **feature value</p>
<p>(optional) where feature value is a new LoadLeveler feature value to be set for the nodes being updated. xCAT will add this value to the LoadLeveler machine definition after the update has completed. This can be useful for users that wish to schedule jobs that can only be run on nodes that have been updated.</p>
<p><strong>updateall = yes | no</strong></p>
<p>Specifies whether this rolling update request is for the updateall method of specifying nodes. Default is <strong>no</strong>.</p>
<p>This method should be used for simple compute node updates that have no special dependencies on other nodes and the update order is not important. Only those nodes that are currently active in the scheduler will be updated.</p>
<p>If <strong>updateall=yes</strong>, the following stanza entries MUST also be specified:</p>
<p><strong>updateall_nodes</strong></p>
<p><strong>updateall_nodecount</strong></p>
<p><strong>job_template</strong></p>
<p><strong>job_dir</strong></p>
<p>**updateall_nodes = **xCAT noderange</p>
<p>Used with <strong>updateall=yes</strong>. The xCAT nodereange specifies the list of nodes that are to be included in this rolling update request (see the xCAT <strong>noderange</strong> man page).. All nodes must be active in the job scheduler in order to be updated.</p>
<p>**updateall_nodecount = **numeric value</p>
<p>Used with updateall=yes. The numeric value specifies the number of nodes that will be reserved at one time in the scheduler and updated together. The smaller the number, the more scheduler reservation jobs that will be submitted.</p>
<p>NOTE: LoadLeveler performance decreases with large numbers of reservations. Do not set this value so low that you will exceed the maximum number of reservations allowed for your cluster or that you will degrade LL performance for your production jobs. You must also ensure that the LL MAX_RESERVATIONS setting is large enough to handle all the reservations that will be created.</p>
<p>**updategroup = **name(noderange)</p>
<p>For standard updates, at least one <strong>updategroup</strong> or <strong>mapgroups</strong> stanza must be specified. The name specifies the name to be assigned to this update group. The noderange is an xCAT noderange that specifies the list of nodes that will be included in this update group (see the xCAT <strong>noderange</strong> man page).</p>
<p>Multiple <strong>updategroup</strong> stanzas may be supplied, one for each group of nodes to be updated.</p>
<p>**mapgroups = **nodegroup range</p>
<p>For standard updates, at least one <strong>updategroup</strong> or <strong>mapgroups</strong> stanza must be specified. . The nodegroup range specifies a list or range of xCAT nodegroup names. This field is processed in the same way the xCAT noderange processing works for node names, except that it will generate a list of xCAT nodegroup names. Each nodegroup in the list will become its own update group for this rolling update request, with the update group name set to the nodegroup name.</p>
<p>Multiple <strong>mapgroups</strong> stanzas may be supplied.</p>
<p>For example, the following will create 10 updategroups from the 10 nodegroups named block01 to block10:</p>
<p>mapgroups=block[01-10]</p>
<p>**mutex = **updategroup,updategroup,...</p>
<p>(optional) Mutual exclusion for standard updates. The comma-delimited list of updategroup names specify which update groups are mutually exclusive and must not be updated at the same time in order to maintain active resources within the cluster. By default, only one updategroup listed in the entry will be updated at a time (see <strong>mutex_count</strong> below to change this default).</p>
<p>You may list multiple <strong>mutex</strong> stanzas to identify different sets of mutual exclusion.</p>
<p>For example, the following states that the update processes for ns1 and for ns2 will not be allowed to run at the same time:</p>
<p>mutex=ns1,ns2</p>
<p>**mutex = **updategroup range,updategroup range,...</p>
<p>(optional) For standard updates. The comma-delimited list of updategroup ranges will be processed in the same way the xCAT noderange processing works for node names, except that it will generate a list of rolling update update group names. The first name in each range is paired together to make a mutual exclusion list, the second name in each range is paired together, etc.</p>
<p>For example, the following single entry:</p>
<p>mutex=block[1-3]a,block[1-3]b,block[1-3]c</p>
<p>would be equivalent to specifying these three entries:</p>
<p>mutex=block1a,block1b,block1c</p>
<p>mutex=block2a,block2b,block2c</p>
<p>mutex=block3a,block3b,block3c</p>
<p>**nodegroup_mutex = **nodegroup name</p>
<p>(optional) For standard updates. Mutual exclusion for any nodes in this xCAT nodegroup. For each updategroup listed above, if any nodes in that group are a member of this xCAT nodegroup, add it to the mutex entry.</p>
<p>For example, you specifiy:</p>
<p>nodegroup_mutex=IOservers</p>
<p>Where your xCAT nodegroup is defined as:</p>
<p>IOservers=n4,n8,n12</p>
<p>And your updategroups specified above are:</p>
<p>updategroup=CEC1(n1-n4)</p>
<p>updategroup=CEC2(n5-n8)</p>
<p>updategroup=CEC3(n9-n12)</p>
<p>updategroup=CEC4(n13-n16)</p>
<p>The following mutex will be created:</p>
<p>mutex=CEC1,CEC2,CEC3</p>
<p>By default, only one of these update groups will be updated at a time unless a different mutex_count is specified for this stanza (see mutex_count below).</p>
<p>**nodegroup_mutex = **nodegroup name range</p>
<p>(optional) For standard updates. Specify multiple nodegroup_mutex statements with a single stanza. The nodegroup name range is expanded to list of xCAT nodegroup names. This then becomes equivalent to multiple nodegroup_mutex stanzas.</p>
<p>For example, this stanza:</p>
<p>nodegroup_mutex=block[1-3]IO</p>
<p>would be equivalent to:</p>
<p>nodegroup_mutex=block1IO</p>
<p>nodegroup_mutex=block2IO</p>
<p>nodegroup_mutex=block3IO</p>
<p>Which, in turn, would be evaluated to create the correct mutex statements following the nodegroup_mutex processing described above.</p>
<p>**mutex_count = **numeric value</p>
<p>(optional) where numeric value is the number of update groups in a mutex statement that can be run at the same time. For example, if you have:</p>
<p>mutex=c1,c2,c3,c4</p>
<p>mutex_count=3</p>
<p>No more than 3 of the listed update groups may be processed at the same time, leaving at least one group of nodes active at all times.</p>
<p>The mutex_count stanza ONLY applies to the previous mutex or nodegroup_mutex stanza.</p>
<p>The default is 1.</p>
<p>**translatenames = **noderange:|pattern|replacement|</p>
<p>**translatenames = **noderange:/pattern/replacement/</p>
<p>(optional) If your scheduler will be using names for nodes that are different from xCAT node names (e.g. the scheduler is using a different administrative network), you will need to tell xCAT how to translate from xCAT node names to the node names registered with your scheduler.</p>
<p>pattern and replacement are perl regular expressions to be performed on the node names in noderange. See the xcatdb man page for more details on using regular expressions. Multiple translatenames stanzas are allowed. If an xCAT nodename exists in more than one noderange, the last translated value will be used.</p>
<p>For example, to translate names of the form &quot;bb1s1&quot; to &quot;bb1sn1&quot;: translatenames=service:|bb(+)s(+)|bb($1)sn($2)|</p>
<p>To translate names of the form &quot;node20&quot; to &quot;node20-hf2&quot; translatenames=compute:/\z/-hf2/</p>
<p>**maxupdates = **_numeric value _| <strong>all</strong></p>
<p>where _numeric value _is the maximum number of update groups that can be updated at one time (i.e. the maximum number of LoadLeveler rolling update reservations that can be active). This allows you to ensure you will always have enough computing resources in your cluster and that not all nodes will attempt to be updated at once.</p>
<p>A value of <strong>all</strong> specifies that there is no restriction.</p>
<p>**reconfiglist = **<em>xCAT_nodelist</em></p>
<p>where <em>xCAT_nodelist</em> is the list of nodes (as known by xCAT) that xCAT will xdsh a LoadLeveler 'llctl reconfig' command to. xCAT will always send the reconfig command to the local xCAT management node, and to all nodes listed as the LL central managers and LL resource managers in the LL database. This is a list of additional machines required to immediately see any database changes xCAT may make. For example, all LL submit-only nodes should be added to this list so that any machine FEATURE changes are visible for job submission.</p>
<p>**jobtemplate = **<em>filename</em></p>
<p>where _filename _is a filename with full directory path that identifies the scheduler job command file template to be used to submit reservations. See sample LoadLeveler templates in:</p>
<p>/opt/xcat/share/xcat/rollupdate/*.tmpl</p>
<p>It is recommended that you take a copy of one of these sample files and edit it for your cluster. You may need to add a &quot;# @ CLASS&quot; entry or other stanzas in order to properly run the reservation in your cluster.</p>
<p>The following substitution values will be replaced by the xCAT rollupdate command to generate a unique job command file for each update group:</p>
<pre><code>**[NODESET]** \- the update group name for this reservation 
**[JOBDIR]** \- the directory specified in the rollupdate input **jobdir** stanza 
**[LLHOSTFILE]** \- (standard method, do NOT remove) the file generated by the xCAT rollupdate command that contains the list of LL machines in this update group that were available at the time the command was run. 
**[[MUTEXRESOURCES]**] - (do NOT remove) The list of LL resources created by xCAT to handle mutual exclusion and maxupdates 
**[LLCOUNT]** \- (required for updateall method, do NOT remove) used by xCAT to set the number of machines to reserve 
**[UPDATEALLFEATURE]** \- (required by updateall method, do NOT remove) used by xCAT to control the rolling update </code></pre>
<p>**jobdir = **<em>directory</em></p>
<p>where _directory _is the directory to write the generated LoadLeveler job command files and other xCAT rolling update data files to. For LL, this directory needs to be on a filesystem available to all nodes.</p>
<p>**reservationcallback = **<em>/</em>opt/xcat/bin/rollupdate</p>
<p>INTERNAL KEYWORD used for development only. This is the reservation notify or callback command. For Loadleveler, this script must reside on the LoadLeveler central manager and will be called when the reservation for an updategroup becomes active.</p>
<p>**reservationduration = **<em>time</em></p>
<p>where _time _is the maximum time to hold a LoadLeveler reservation for the update process. This value in minutes should be longer than the expected time to shutdown, update, and reboot all the nodes in an update group. xCAT will release the nodes from the reservation as they come back up, and will cancel the reservation when the last node has completed.</p>
<p><strong>update_if_down = yes | no | cancel</strong></p>
<p>Specifies whether nodes that are not active in the job scheduler should be updated.</p>
<p>For the rollupdate updateall method, only nodes with active startd daemons can be updated.</p>
<ul>
<li>If update_if_down is set to <strong>cancel</strong>, and specified nodes are not active in LoadLeveler, this update will be cancelled.</li>
<li>If update_if_down is set to <strong>no</strong>, any specified nodes that are not active will be skipped (the assumption is that those nodes will load the new image the next time they are brought back online).</li>
<li>A value of <strong>yes</strong> is not supported for the updateall method.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the standard rollupdate method, only reservations for machines with status known to LoadLeveler can be created.</p>
<ul>
<li>If update_if_down is set to <strong>cancel</strong>, and specified nodes do not have an active startd daemon in LoadLeveler, this update group will not be processed.</li>
<li>If update_if_down is set to <strong>no</strong>, any specified nodes in the update_group that do not have an active startd daemon will be skipped. The assumption is that those nodes will load the new image the next time they are brought back online.</li>
<li>If update_if_down is set to <strong>yes</strong>, ALL nodes in the update groups will be processed. A LoadLeveler reservation will be created for those nodes in an update group whose machine status is known to LoadLeveler, even if the startd daemon is down. When submitting a reservation, the llmkres -D flag is used to allow reservations for &quot;down&quot; nodes. When that reservation becomes active, all nodes in the update group (both LL and non-LL) will then be processed. If no nodes in the update group are known to LoadLeveler, the group will be processed directly as part of this rollupdate call. This option is useful for including nodes in the update process that are not used for running jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Default: <strong>update_if_down=cancel</strong></p>
<p>**prescript = **<em>command string</em></p>
<p>**prescriptnodes = **<em>noderange</em></p>
<p>(optional) where _command _is the name of a command to be run on the xCAT management node before issuing the shutdown command for the nodes in the updategroup.</p>
<p><strong>prescriptnodes</strong> is only supported with the standard rollupdate method. If it is also specified, the command will only be run for the nodes being updated from the updategroup that are also included in that xCAT <em>noderange</em>. If <strong>prescriptnodes</strong> is not specified (and for the updateall method), the command will be run for all the nodes in the updategroup.</p>
<p>For <strong>prescript</strong>, you may specify the string $NODELIST in the <em>command string</em> if you would like the comma-delimited list of xCAT nodenames passed into your command.</p>
<p>Prescripts can be used to run operations such as shutting down the global filesystem on all the nodes, or moving critical services to a backup server for specific nodes.</p>
<p>All prescripts must be executable by root.</p>
<p>Multiple <strong>prescript</strong> entries or <strong>prescript</strong>/<strong>prescriptnodes</strong> pairs of entries may be specified. Each command will be run in order.</p>
<p>**skipshutdown = yes | no **</p>
<p>Specifies whether sending a shutdown command to the nodes should be skipped. This should only be set to &quot;yes&quot; for updates to stateful nodes that are using rollupdate prescripts to apply updates to the nodes. No power down or reboot operation will be done, and no out-of-band scripts will be run. The bringupstatus/bringupappstatus values will be checked to determine when the update is complete after prescripts have run. Once the status is reached, the nodes will be removed from the scheduler reservation.</p>
<p>Default value is &quot;no&quot;, all nodes will be shutdown and powered off.</p>
<p>**shutdowntimeout = **<em>time</em></p>
<p>(optional) where _time _is the number of minutes xCAT should wait for an OS shutdown to complete before giving up and issuing a hard power off command and continuing with the rolling update process.</p>
<p>Default: <strong>shutdowntimeout=5</strong></p>
<p>**outofbandcmd = **<em>command string</em></p>
<p>**outofbandnodes = **<em>noderange</em></p>
<p>(optional) where _command _is the name of a command to be run on the xCAT management node after the node has been shutdown but before it is rebooted.</p>
<p><strong>outofbandnodes</strong> is only supported with the standard rollupdate method. If it is also specified, the command will only be run for the nodes being updated from the updategroup that are also included in that xCAT <em>noderange</em>. If <strong>outofbandnodes</strong> is not specified (and for the updateall method), the command will be run for all the nodes in the updategroup.</p>
<p>For <strong>outofbandcmd</strong>, you may specify the string $NODELIST in the <em>command string</em> if you would like the comma-delimited list of xCAT nodenames passed into your command.</p>
<p>Out-of-band commands can be used to run operations when nodes must be powered down such as firmware updates.</p>
<p>All out-of-band commands must be executable by root.</p>
<p>Multiple <strong>outofbandcmd</strong> entries or <strong>outofbandcmd</strong>/<strong>outofbandnodes</strong> pairs of entries may be specified. Each command will be run in order.</p>
<p>**bringuporder = **<em>noderange</em></p>
<p>(optional for standard update method only) where the nodes being updated from the updategroup that are also included in that xCAT _noderange _will be brought up first.</p>
<p>If more than one node in the updategroup matches a <strong>bringuporder</strong> entry, they will be brought up at the same time.</p>
<p>Multiple <strong>bringuporder</strong> entries may be specified, and they will be processed in order, completing bringup of all nodes in the previous entry before starting to power on the nodes in this entry.</p>
<p>Any nodes in the update group that are not listed in a <strong>bringuporder</strong> entry will be brought up at the end. Note that bringuporder will only be applied to nodes within an update group and does NOT affect how the scheduler will schedule the order of processing different update groups.</p>
<p>**bringupstatus = **<em>status value</em></p>
<p>OR</p>
<p><strong>bringupappstatus</strong>_ = appstatus value_</p>
<p>(optional) The xCAT database node <em>status</em> or node <em>appstatus</em> value that xCAT will check and will wait for to determine that the node is up. Once this status is reached, xCAT will continue bringing up more nodes (if <strong>bringuporder</strong> is set) and will release this node from the scheduler reservation. If both attributes are set, only <strong>bringupappstatus</strong> will be used.</p>
<p>Default: <strong>bringupstatus=booted</strong></p>
<p><strong>bringuptimeout</strong>_ = time_</p>
<p>(optional) The maximum <em>time</em> in minutes xCAT should wait after issuing the rpower on command for the nodes to reach <strong>bringupstatus</strong> or <strong>bringupappstatus</strong> before giving up. If using <strong>bringuporder</strong> and this timeout is reached for one set of nodes, no additional nodes will be attempted to be brought up. The scheduler reservation will be cancelled.</p>
<p>Default: <strong>bringuptimeout=10</strong></p>
<h2 id="loadleveler-settings"><a href="#TOC"><strong>LoadLeveler Settings</strong></a></h2>
<p>LoadLeveler must be running with the database configuration option in order to use the xCAT rolling update support.</p>
<p>The root userid on the xCAT management node must have LOADL_ADMIN privileges.</p>
<p>LoadLeveler provides many settings to support and control reservations in your job scheduler. Review the LoadLeveler documentation for a full list of these controls to ensure they are set correctly to support the flexible reservation jobs that will be submitted for xCAT rolling updates.</p>
<p>A few key settings are listed here:</p>
<pre><code>SCHEDULER_TYPE=BACKFILL
MAX_RESERVATIONS</code></pre>
<p>For each machine definition (or in the default machine definition):</p>
<pre><code>reservation_permitted = true</code></pre>
<p>For the <em>scheduser</em> LL userid specified in your xCAT rollupdate input stanzas (or the default LL user):</p>
<pre><code>max_reservation_duration
max_reservation_expiration
max_reservations</code></pre>
<p>If you do not have a schedd daemon running on your xCAT management node, at least one LL machine must be defined as a public scheduler, by setting SCHEDD_HOST for that machine:</p>
<pre><code> SCHEDD_HOST=true</code></pre>
<p>Since xCAT changes LL FEATURE values for machine definitions during the rolling update process, prior to LoadLeveler 5.1.0.1-3 you cannot use LL Machine Groups, and you must have explicit machine definitions for each node. In that case, you should run with machine_authenticate set:</p>
<pre><code> MACHINE_AUTHENTICATE=true</code></pre>
<p>Every node that is to be scheduled by LoadLeveler for updating must have a startd daemon running. If you do not wish to have any user jobs running on this node (e.g. this is a storage node), you should not allow any max_starters:</p>
<pre><code> STARTD_RUNS_HERE=true
 MAX_STARTERS=0</code></pre>
<p>During the rolling update process, even though a node may be rebooted, the machine status will still appear to be running when queried with LL status commands. You should have your node configured to automatically start the LL daemons again after it reboots, either through an operating system mechanism such as /etc/inittab or chkconfig, or through an xCAT postscript for diskless nodes. Then when xCAT removes the node from the flexible reservation used to update the node, LL can start running jobs again on the updated node.</p>
<p>The following LL setting is not unique to xCAT Rolling Updates, but required for any LL cluster that has nodes defined with no swap space, which is the case for xCAT diskless or statelite nodes:</p>
<pre><code> VM_IMAGE_ALGORITHM=FREE_PAGING_SPACE_PLUS_FREE_REAL_MEMORY</code></pre>
<p>LL settings that may be used or changed by xCAT Rolling Updates:</p>
<pre><code>FLOATING_RESOURCES
SCHEDULE_BY_RESOURCES
CENTRAL_MANAGER_LIST
RESOURCE_MGR_LIST
(for machines) FEATURE</code></pre>
<h2 id="rolling-update-process-flow"><a href="#TOC"><strong>Rolling Update Process Flow</strong></a></h2>
<p>The general process flow for the xCAT Rolling Update support is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create your new OS image(s) that will be used to update the nodes. Follow the appropriate xCAT documentation for creating or updating an image. Note that you still have all of your cluster nodes actively using the current image, so you will most likely need to create a new image. For AIX diskless nodes, you will also need to create new NIM machine definitions so that you can assign NIM resources and run the xCAT mkdsklsnode -n command without impacting the current active nodes.</li>
<li>If you are using Linux service nodes that do not have the /install directory mounted, be sure to copy the new image down to your service nodes.</li>
<li>Run all necessary xCAT commands to prepare to boot the nodes with the new OS image (nodeset, mkdsklsnode).</li>
<li>If you wish to have your LoadLeveler users be able to run jobs on either just old nodes or just updated nodes during the rolling update process, you should set a LL FEATURE value for all of the machine definitions in your cluster. You can then specify this as an <strong>oldfeature</strong> stanza value in your rollupdate command input. Also, be sure to specify a <strong>newfeature</strong> stanza value to identify updated nodes. Your users can use these feature values in their job &quot;requirements field.</li>
<li>Create your rollupdate command input stanza file. See the chapter on <a href="#rollupdate-input-stanza-file">rollupdate Input Stanza File</a>for details.</li>
<li>(Optional) If you wish to view the progress of the rollupdate process, in a separate window, open and monitor the rollupdate log: <code>tail -f /var/log/xcat/rollupdate.log</code>xCAT appends to the log file with each rollupdate run, so you may wish to move or remove the log file before a new rollupdate process.</li>
<li>Initiate the rollupdate process: <code>cat &amp;lt;your stanza file&amp;gt; | rollupdate --verbose</code>If you want to test your input first to make sure it is what you want, and to view the LL reservation job command files and other data files generated by xCAT, run the command with the test option: <code>cat &amp;lt;your stanza file&amp;gt; | rollupdate -test --verbose</code>The output files will be placed in the directory you specified in the <strong>jobdir</strong> stanza. The verbose keyword is optional, but allows you to view detailed progress.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rollupdate command will do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process the stanza file and create update groups based on the input provided.</li>
<li>Create LoadLeveler FLOATING_RESOURCES and set SCHEDULE_BY_RESOURCES for all mutual exclusion sets and for controlling the maximum number of updates allowed.</li>
<li>Run llstatus to query LoadLeveler for a list of nodes with active startd daemons.</li>
<li>For each update group, the following will be done:
<ul>
<li>Process the update_if_down stanza entry and determine if this update group can be run:</li>
<li>For the rollupdate updateall method, only nodes with active startd daemons can be updated.
<ul>
<li>If update_if_down is set to &quot;cancel&quot;, and specified nodes are not active in LoadLeveler, this update will be cancelled.</li>
<li>If update_if_down is set to &quot;no&quot;, any specified nodes that are not active will be skipped (the assumption is that those nodes will load the new image the next time they are brought back online).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For the standard rollupdate method, only reservations for active LL nodes can be created.
<ul>
<li>If update_if_down is set to &quot;cancel&quot;, and specified nodes are not active in LoadLeveler, this update group will not be processed.</li>
<li>If update_if_down is set to &quot;no, any specified nodes in the update_group that are not active will be skipped. The assumption is that those nodes will load the new image the next time they are brought back online.</li>
<li>If update_if_down is set to &quot;yes&quot;, a LoadLeveler reservation will only be created for the active nodes in the group, and when that reservation becomes active, all nodes in the group (both LL and non-LL) will be processed. This is useful for nodes that are not used for running jobs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Load your LoadLeveler job command file template, and fill in all substituion values to create a unique job command file for this update group.</li>
<li>Create the xCAT rollupdate data file for this update group to pass important data to the xCAT runrollupdate process that is run when the reservation becomes active. The data file contains the full list of xCAT nodes to be processed, all prescripts and out-of-band commands, old and new LoadLeveler feature values to be changed for the node, and other information to control the update process for this update group.</li>
<li>Create a notify script for this update group for LoadLeveler to run when the reservation becomes active.</li>
<li>For the updateall method, a unique LoadLeveler feature value for this update will be set in all specified nodes to control the update process.</li>
<li>Set the xCAT appstatus &quot;RollingUpdate=update_job_submitted&quot; for all the nodes in the update group.</li>
<li>Run the llmkres command to submit the flexible reservation for this update group, specifying the notify script created above.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If any update groups do NOT have any nodes that are active in LoadLeveler, and update_if_down=yes, LoadLeveler cannot be used to process those nodes. Those update groups will be handled directly by the rollupdate command following the same process below (skipping any steps related to LoadLeveler).</li>
<li><p>Monitoring:</p>
<p>You can view the flexible reservations that xCAT submitted:</p>
<p>llqres</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>llqres -l -R &lt;reservation id&gt;</p>
<p>for a specific reservation. If any reservation is stuck in a &quot;Waiting&quot; status that you feel should be active, you can check the job associated with the reservation (find the job id from the llqres -l output above):</p>
<p>llq -s &lt;job id&gt;</p>
<p>and debug as you would for any LL reservation or job.</p></li>
<li>When a reservation becomes active, LoadLeveler will invoke the notify script created above. This will invoke the internal xCAT runrollupdate command for the update group.</li>
<li>The xCAT runrollupdate will proceed as follows for an update group:
<ul>
<li>If this is for the updateall method, query the LoadLeveler reservation to get the list of nodes that have been reserved for this update group.</li>
<li>Query the xCAT appstatus for each node to ensure it is set correctly</li>
<li>Run the prescripts for the update group</li>
<li>Shut down and power off all the nodes in the update group</li>
<li>Run the out-of-band commands for the update group</li>
<li>Reboot the nodes. If bringuporder stanzas were set in the rollupdate input, the nodes will be booted in the order specified, waiting until the bringupstatus or bringupappstatus values have been set.</li>
<li>As soon as a node is up, the LoadLeveler feature values for the node will be changed, removing the oldfeature value and the xCAT updateall feature value (if applicable), and setting the newfeature value if these were specified in the rollupdate input.</li>
<li>The reservation is changed to remove the node that is up. This node is now available for running jobs again. If this is the last node, the reservation will be cancelled.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="updating-xcat"><a href="#TOC"><strong>Updating xCAT</strong></a></h2>
<p>Updating xCAT software as part of the rolling update process is not supported. The xCAT software on your management node can be updated without impacting your running cluster, and should be done manually. See <a href="Setting_Up_a_Linux_xCAT_Mgmt_Node">Setting_Up_a_Linux_xCAT_Mgmt_Node</a> for instructions on updating your xCAT management node.</p>
<p>In hierarchical clusters, the xCAT rolling update process should not be used to update the xCAT software on service nodes. See the xCAT hierarchical documents: <a href="Setting_Up_an_AIX_Hierarchical_Cluster">Setting_Up_an_AIX_Hierarchical_Cluster</a> or <a href="Setting_Up_a_Linux_Hierarchical_Cluster">Setting_Up_a_Linux_Hierarchical_Cluster</a>.</p>
<h2 id="rolling-updates-in-a-hierarchical-cluster"><a href="#TOC"><strong>Rolling Updates in a Hierarchical Cluster</strong></a></h2>
<p><em>Restrictions:</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Support for including infrastructure nodes such as Service Nodes and GPFS I/O nodes in update groups is released as &quot;experimental only&quot;. All required function has been coded and unit tested by xCAT development, but this support has not been tested in a formal Functional Verification Test or System Test environment.</li>
<li>For Power 775 clusters, the GPFS I/O nodes and the compute nodes are typically installed as statelite nodes, mounting persistent directories through soft NFS mounts served by their service nodes. While it may be possible that a compute node can continue to operate when its service node goes down, the continued operation of the GPFS I/O nodes and the availability of your GPFS filesystems may be compromised. The xCAT rolling update solution will not be supported for service nodes (which includes firmware updates of CECs in which a service node resides) until a high-availability solution is in place for these clusters, or if you have implemented a cluster solution that allows GPFS filesystems to remain operational when any service node goes down.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are performing a rolling update in an xCAT hierarchical cluster, there are a few special considerations that you will need to address if your service nodes will be rebooted as part of the update process. Normally, you should try to update your service nodes manually outside of the xCAT rolling update process so that you have more control over the update. However, if you are performing CEC firmware updates, and will need to power down the CEC that contains your service node, you will need to think about the services your service node is providing to your compute nodes and how to plan your updates.</p>
<p>If at all possible, you should create your update groups such that a service node and all of the compute nodes it serves can be updated together at one time. When you use this approach, make sure to use the <strong>bringuporder</strong> stanza in the rollupdate command input to bring up your service node first so that it is running when your compute nodes start to come up.</p>
<p>If it is not possible to update an entire block of service node with compute nodes because you will lose critical cluster services, you will need to plan more carefully. First, you can only bring down a service node if you have some type of backup for the services it is providing your compute nodes, or if you can tolerate the temporary loss of those services. Some things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have Linux statelite nodes or AIX diskless nodes and your service node is your NFS server, you can only bring this down if you have an HA NFS solution in place. Otherwise, bringing down the service node will crash your compute nodes.</li>
<li>If you are doing CEC firmware updates, at a minimum your update groups need to map to all the nodes within a CEC.</li>
<li>You should plan two separate rolling update runs:</li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The first run with just your service nodes CECs. Again, you should use the <strong>bringuporder</strong> stanza in the rollupdate command input to bring up your service node first within an update group so that it is running when your compute nodes in that group start to come up.</li>
<li>The second run with all the remaining CECs in your cluster. Your service nodes should all be up and running, so these compute node updates can be done in any order.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If you have backup service nodes in your cluster, use the <strong>mutex</strong> stanza to set mutual exclusion to ensure your service node and backup service node do not get updated at the same time.</li>
<li>If you are bringing down a node that is running a critical service, use the <strong>prescript</strong> stanza to run a task to move the service to a backup server that is not part of this update group. Also, use the <strong>mutex</strong> stanza to ensure that the node and its backup are not updated at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="updating-ibm-hpc-infrastructure-nodes"><a href="#TOC"><strong>Updating IBM HPC Infrastructure Nodes</strong></a></h2>
<p>If your cluster is running IBM HPC software such as GPFS or LoadLeveler, you have additional cluster services that you will need determine how to update and how to keep active during an xCAT rolling update process. Whenever possible, all cluster infrastructure nodes should be manually updated before running the xCAT rolling update process for compute nodes.</p>
<p>The term &quot;infrastructure nodes&quot; will be used to refer to any nodes that are not compute nodes. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>xCAT management node and backup management node, and xCAT service nodes</li>
<li>GPFS configuration server and backup configuration server, IO servers. monitoring collector node, session node (e.g. for HPSS)</li>
<li>LoadLeveler central manager and backup central manager, region managers, resource managers, schedulers, login nodes</li>
</ul>
<p>It is assumed that most updates to infrastructure nodes can be applied without impacting user jobs running on compute nodes. If xCAT service nodes are stateful (full-disk install) and are also used to run other infrastructure services (such as LL region managers), updates to infrastructure software that runs on these nodes can be applied using the xCAT updatenode command without rebooting the node. For updates to other servers that are running diskless or statelite images (e.g. GPFS IO servers), these nodes can be rebooted individually to load a new OS image without impacting the rest of the cluster.</p>
<h3 id="gpfs"><a href="#TOC">GPFS</a></h3>
<p>GPFS software can be migrated to a new level one node at a time without impacting the running GPFS cluster. In order to upgrade GPFS, the GPFS daemons must be stopped and all GPFS filesystems must be unmounted on the node. For GPFS infrastructure nodes, it is important to manage the updates such that all GPFS cluster services remain operational.</p>
<p>When updating GPFS, the following will need to be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>When updating the GPFS configuration server, the service must first be moved to the backup configuration server.</li>
<li>Quorum must be maintained at all times. No more than half-minus-one quorum nodes can be down at any time.</li>
<li>Updates of the GPFS I/O servers in an NSD group must be staged so that filesystems are always available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please consult the <a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/clresctr/vxrx/topic/com.ibm.cluster.gpfs.doc/gpfsbooks.html">GPFS documentation</a> for updating your GPFS software.</p>
<h3 id="loadleveler"><a href="#TOC">LoadLeveler</a></h3>
<p>LoadLeveler infrastructure nodes (nodes running the central manager, resource manager, and region manager daemons) are required to all be running the same version of LL. For maintaining critical cluster services, these daemons should all have backup servers. Locating both primary and backup servers on the xCAT management node or service nodes, and using full-disk install service nodes (i.e. not diskless) will ensure the best cluster stability during a rolling update process. In order to upgrade LL simultaneously on these nodes while still allowing jobs to run on the cluster, the LL software should be updated before running the rolling update process for your cluster. You should do this manually following the documented LoadLeveler procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li>If any primary servers are also running startd daemons, drain the startd or flush the nodes.</li>
<li>If any primary servers are running schedd daemons, drain the schedd or use llmovespool to move the job queue to another schedd server, and then drain the schedd.</li>
<li>Stop the primary daemons</li>
<li>Make sure failover to backup daemons has occurred</li>
<li>Upgrade LoadLeveler on the servers</li>
<li>Restart LoadLeveler on the servers</li>
<li>Make sure primary daemons take back control</li>
<li>Upgrade LoadLeveler on backup servers</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/clresctr/vxrx/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cluster.loadl.doc/llbooks.html">LoadLeveler documentation</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="cec-updates"><a href="#TOC">CEC Updates</a></h3>
<p>Updating infrastructure nodes that require a node or CEC reboot is more complicated because the nodes and cluster-wide services that depend on them must be considered in the update algorithm.</p>
<p>Update groups must be defined to encompass a complete CEC. When an update group is being updated, the cluster-wide services that need to be maintained during the update are:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPFS configuration server</li>
<li>GPFS quorum</li>
<li>GPFS filesystem access</li>
<li>LoadLeveler services</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, you should use separate <strong>mutex</strong> stanzas in your xCAT rollupdate command input to define the following mutual exclusion sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>service nodes in a building block: Only one service node CEC may be updated at a time.</li>
<li>GPFS I/O servers: If you have defined multiple GPFS I/O servers for each filesystem to provide continuous availability, only one GPFS I/O server CEC for each filesystem may be updated at a time</li>
<li>GPFS quorum nodes: Only less than half the quorum nodes can be updated at a time.</li>
<li>GPFS configuration server and backup: only one can be updated at a time. You should not attempt to perform any GPFS configuration changes during the update process.</li>
</ul>
<p>RESTRICTION NOTE: For LoadLeveler servers and their backups that may be running on service nodes in your cluster, xCAT rolling updates currently MUST NOT include any CECS containing nodes actively running as the LL central manager, resource manager, region managers, or schedd servers. Coordinating automatic updates and reboots of these servers while still maintaining full LoadLeveler operation for jobs queued and running across the cluster is very complex. It may be possible to provide rollupdate prescripts to automatically move these services to backups during the update process, but that has not been tested, and the stability of LoadLeveler during such an update has not been verified. At a minimum, the xcatd daemon on the xCAT management node requires continuous contact with the LL central manager to perform the rolling update operations and will not be able to tolerate outages while the central manager migrates to its backup server.</p>
<p>All CECS with xCAT service nodes should be updated before updating the other CECs. This will ensure that the service node will be available when a compute node reboots and needs to load a new OS image. Therefore, two separate xCAT rollupdates should be performed - the first one for the service node CECs only, and the second one for all the other CECs in the cluster. When updating a service node CEC, make sure to set the bringup_order such that the service node is activated before trying to bring up other nodes in that CEC.</p>
<p>Use the <strong>prescript</strong> and <strong>prescriptnodes</strong> stanzas to define tasks that should be run to move critical services to their backup servers before shutting down those nodes during an update.</p>
<h2 id="hints-tips"><a href="#TOC">Hints &amp; Tips</a></h2>
<p>This section contains random hints and tips for working with the xCAT Rolling Update support.</p>
<pre><code>NOTE: This section is a on-going &quot;work in progress&quot;. As you gain experience with the xCAT Rolling Update support, feel free to update this section with your favorite tidbits of information that may help others. </code></pre>
<h3 id="are-things-really-working"><a href="#TOC">Are things really working?</a></h3>
<p>You have run your rollupdate command and submitted the reservations to LoadLeveler. How do you know things are really working? Here are a few hints:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, read through the section above on <strong>Rolling Update Process Flow</strong>. This will give you an idea of how things work and some basic monitoring suggestions.</li>
<li><p>If you have run rollupdate with the --verbose option, watch the log output:</p>
<p>tail -F /var/log/xcat/rollupdate.log</p>
<p>You should see entries appear when xcatd receives a callback invocation from the activation of a LoadLeveler reservation and details of processing that update group.</p></li>
<li><p>View the RollUpdate appstatus value for your nodes:</p>
<p>lsdef &lt;noderange&gt; -i appstatus,appstatustime</p>
<p>The rollupdate process will change the appstatus value for the &quot;RollingUpdate&quot; application. The appstatustime is set to the last time ANY application changed the appstatus value, so it may not accurately reflect the last time appstatus was changed for rolling updates. appstatus values include:</p></li>
<li><strong>update_job_submitted</strong>: the LL reservation has been submitted, but xcatd has not received a callback invocation for this node yet</li>
<li><strong>running_prescripts</strong>: xcatd is running your specified prescripts for this node</li>
<li><strong>shutting_down</strong>: xcatd has sent an OS shutdown command to the node</li>
<li><strong>shutdowntimeout_exceeded__forcing_rpower_off</strong>: xcatd had sent an OS shutdown command to the node, but the shutdowntimeout time had been exceeded before the node reached a powered off state. xcatd has now sent an 'rpower off' command to the node to force the shutdown.</li>
<li><strong>running_outofbandcmds</strong>: xcatd is running your specified outofbandcmds for this node</li>
<li><strong>rebooting</strong>: xcatd has sent an 'rpower on' command to the node</li>
<li><strong>waiting_on_bringuporder</strong>: You have specified a bringuporder for nodes in this updategroup. This node is waiting on some other node to complete bringup before xcatd can issue an rpower on command.</li>
<li><strong>update_complete</strong>: xcatd has successfully completed the rolling update for this node</li>
<li><strong>ERROR_bringuptimeout_exceeded</strong>: xcatd has sent an 'rpower on' command to this node, and is querying the node's status (or appstatus) attributes for the bringupstatus (bringupappstatus) value. However, the bringuptimeout time has been exceeded and the status value has not been set.</li>
<li><p><strong>ERROR_bringuptimeout_exceeded_for_previous_node</strong>: You have specified a bringuporder for nodes in this update group. This node was waiting for a node higher in the bringuporder to complete its bringup process. However, that node had an <strong>ERROR_bringuptimeout_exceeded</strong> failure, so the bringup process for this node was cancelled. No 'rpower on' command was sent to this node to attempt to bring it up. It is still powered down.</p></li>
<li>Use LoadLeveler status and query commands to view the state of your nodes and your flexible reservations. Some commands that are useful:
<ul>
<li>llstatus</li>
<li>llstatus -L machine</li>
<li>llstatus -F</li>
<li>llqres</li>
<li>llqres -l -R &lt;reservation id&gt;</li>
<li>llq</li>
<li>llq -s &lt;job id&gt;</li>
<li>llconifig -d FLOATING_RESOURCES SCHEDULE_BY_RESOURCES</li>
<li>llconfig -h &lt;hostlist&gt; -d FEATURE</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Verify that your LoadLeveler reservations will eventually be activated once nodes become available. Refer to the LoadLeveler product documentation for help in figuring this out. This may take some debug and investigation work on your part and is outside the scope of this document.</p>
<p>Note that based on your rollupdate <em>mutex</em>, <em>nodegroup_mutex</em>, <em>maxupdates</em>, and <em>updateall</em> input stanza entries, xCAT sets LL FLOATING_RESOURCES, SCHEDULE_BY_RESOURCES, and machine FEATURE values in your LL database that are used by the reservation job command file that is submitted to LL. Errors in these entries may prevent your reservations from activating.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="loadleveler-flexible-reservations"><a href="#TOC">LoadLeveler Flexible Reservations</a></h3>
<p>The xCAT rolling update process is tightly integrated with the LoadLeveler Flexible Reservation support. Based on your input to the rollupdate command, xCAT generates and submits LL flexible reservations, and then relies on LL to notify xcatd when the reservation becomes active so that the nodes can be updated.</p>
<p>As input, the rollupdate command uses the LL job command template file you specify in the <em>jobtemplate</em> input stanza. xCAT provides sample template files in /opt/xcat/share/xcat/rollupdate. When customizing this template, be sure to keep the substitution strings created by xCAT, especially those for node counts, Feature requirements, and step_resources. xCAT relies on these to control the proper activation of reservations based on your input specifications.</p>
<p>The rollupdate command will use the input stanzas and this template to generate multiple files. They will be placed in the directory you specified with the <em>jobdir</em> stanza. Files that are generated include (&lt;my_rollupdate_input&gt; | rollupdate --verbose --test</p>
<h3 id="running-ll-jobs-on-old-and-new-nodes"><a href="#TOC">Running LL jobs on &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; nodes</a></h3>
<p>While the xCAT rolling update is in process, and depending on the nature of the updates being made, it may be important to control user jobs such that they only run on all old nodes or on all updated nodes. There is nothing inherent in the xCAT rolling update process or in LoadLeveler that will control this for you.</p>
<p>However, you may be able to take advantage of LL machine FEATURE definitions and cluster job filters to help you with this issue. One possible process to control your jobs may be as follows:</p>
<p>1. Add a value to all of your machine definition FEATURE attributes to indicate the nodes are in an &quot;old&quot; state.</p>
<p>2. Create a job filter so that all jobs that are submitted will require this FEATURE value.</p>
<p>3. Submit your xCAT rolling update process specifying the &quot;old_feature&quot; and &quot;new_feature&quot; stanzas.</p>
<p>4. As xCAT updates nodes, it will remove the &quot;old_feature&quot; value and replace it with the &quot;new_feature&quot; value in those LL machine defintions.</p>
<p>5. At some point when a significant number of nodes in your cluster have been updated, you can change your job filter to now require machines with FEATUREs set to the new_feature value.</p>
<p>6. Since the cluster availablity of FEATURE requirements are determined at the time a job is submitted, it may be that some jobs requiring the &quot;old_feature&quot; may no longer have available resources by the time that job gets to run. At this point, you can either cancel the jobs and have them be re-submitted, or once all of the nodes have been updated, again set all the LL machine definition FEATUREs to have both &quot;old_feature&quot; and &quot;new_feature&quot; values to allow those jobs to run.</p>
<p>7. Once all the cluster nodes have been updated, you can remove your job filter changes made for this rolling update process.</p>
<p>8. Once all of the jobs that have been submitted using one of the changed filters has completed running, you can remove both the &quot;old_feature&quot; and &quot;new_feature&quot; values from your machine definitions.</p>
