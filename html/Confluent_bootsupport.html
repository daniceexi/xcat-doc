<p>Confluent will expand role in PXE boot process. xCAT delegates to dhcpd which imposes some steep requirements on some networks and misses opportunity to acheive some things.</p>
<p>To that end, confluent will start listening on 4011 and either providing stub responses over 67 or having dhcpd send next-server on our behalf.</p>
<p>Another feature will be the construction and control of service processor directed boot. This allows us to inject data in a more trustworthy manner, enabling end-to-end secure deployment. This function will likely require configuring which interface to boot from.</p>
<p>More generally speaking, deprecate use of anything but iPXE base. Stop sending iPXE as a step in forcing hard disk boot (either send a dedicated utility for that purpose or nothing at all).</p>
