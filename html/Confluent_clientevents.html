<p>Provide a means by which clients can cheaply have a channel to receive updates on changes as they happen, but not actively poll.</p>
<p>This will be via some resource in the tree. It would behave in many ways similar to a console/session resource. Meaning it can be opened and data will come as it is available depending on the criteria used to initiate a new event session. For the socket interface, it's straightforward as we get to define the semantics just like the console interface. For HTTP interface, the client has to have a long-lived request as a hook for confluent to fire back data (just like console data in the console/session resource)</p>
