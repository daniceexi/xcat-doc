As a maintainer of the xCAT Project, I certify that I will: 

  1. Follow the xCAT Project maintainer guidelines and requirements as found at https://sourceforge.net/p/xcat/wiki/XCAT_Developer_Guide/#maintainers. I recognize that these may be amended from time to time; 
  2. Understand with the terms of the Eclipse Public License, located at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html; 
  3. Have permission from my employer to participate as a Maintainer of the xCAT Project; 
  4. Send this signed and completed agreement to the xCAT Project. All notices required by this agreement should be sent to xcat-legal@lists.sourceforge.net; 
  5. Inform the xCAT Project of any changes in my Contact Information including name, email, and address, and the name and address of my employer; 
  6. Understand that the xCAT Project will have complete control and discretion over which capabilities are assigned to a maintainer account, and may terminate or temporarily disable my Maintainer access for any reason at any time; 
  7. Maintain confidentiality of my passwords issued by the xCAT Project and not allow any other individual or entity to use my password; 
  8. Ensure that all contributions follow the xCAT Project contribution process such that all contributions are licensed under the Eclipse Public License and that all contributors have remitted a completed xCAT Project contribution agreement; 
  9. Maintain a record of all xCAT Project contribution agreements completed by contributors that I have added to the xCAT Project and remit such record to the xCAT Project on a regular basis or whenever requested by other maintainers of the xCAT Project; 
  10. Submit a log entry of each contribution that I commit to the xCAT GIT repository on behalf of a contributor (other than myself), according to the xCAT Project maintainer guidelines and requirements; 
  11. Not include any contributions that I believe may be subject to third party intellectual property claims contrary to the xCAT Contribution process; and 
  12. I understand and agree that the xCAT Project is public and that a record of maintainers and contributions (including all personal information submitted, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with the xCAT Project or the open source license(s) involved.
