Note: these papers, books, and articles contain great information, but they are all one-time efforts and are not updated with each new release of xCAT, so some parts become more out of date as time goes on.&nbsp; We recommend that you start with the official [XCAT_Documentation] and then use the information below as a supplement, recognizing that some of it will be out of date.
