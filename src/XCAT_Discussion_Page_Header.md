We are actively working on improving the xCAT documentation to make it more helpful to you, but we need your input to focus our efforts to the correct places in the documentation. Leave your comments on any of these discussion pages about what info is missing in the documentation, or is inaccurate, or should just be worded more clearly. Several xCAT developers are "watching" the discussion pages, so they should be notified automatically by the wiki about your comments. 

To add your comments to this discussion page you need to first **get editor access to the wiki**. See [Editing_and_Downloading_xCAT_Documentation/#request-editor-access-to-the-wiki](Editing_and_Downloading_xCAT_Documentation/#request-editor-access-to-the-wiki).
