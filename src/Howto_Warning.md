Note: this is a user-contributed document. While this howto contains some very useful information, it is not necessarily updated for new versions of xCAT and therefore may be inaccurate in some cases. Use it with this in mind. We welcome corrections and contributions - see [Editing xCAT Documentation](Editing_and_Downloading_xCAT_Documentation). And see the [XCAT_Documentation] page for documentation that is tested and updated with each xCAT release (to the best of our ability).
