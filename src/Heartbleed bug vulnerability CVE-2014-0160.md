Security Bulletin: Extreme Cloud Administration Tool (xCAT) is affected by a vulnerability in OpenSSL (CVE-2014-0160)

A security vulnerability has been discovered in OpenSSL.

Vulnerability Details 
CVE-ID: CVE-2014-0160 


DESCRIPTION:  OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by an error in the TLS/DTLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose 64k of private memory and retrieve secret keys. This vulnerability can be remotely exploited, authentication is not required and the exploit is not complex. An exploit can affect the confidentially, but not integrity or availability.


 xCAT is using OpenSSL to implement the TLS protocol designed to provide secure communication within an xCAT cluster.


 xCAT uses  the OpenSSL library provided by the operating system.  If the OpenSSL library provided by the operating system has the security vulnerability, then system administrators need to upgrade their system to a version of the OpenSSL library that provides the fix for this security vulnerability and regenerate the OpenSSL keys used by xCAT.
