_**This is old info!**_

The goal for xcat documentation is that we have a single source for each type of documentation. Then we can automatically convert it, or link to it from a bunch of places, but we only have one source to maintain. Here's where the source of each type of documentation should be: 


## Reference Material

  * This gives all the details of each command, file format, and DB table 
  * The source is man pages in POD format 
  * Automatically convert to nroff man pages and html pages 
  * Html pages go in rpms and on web site 
  * Link to html pages from cookbooks, etc. 

## Task-Oriented

  * Using xCAT in specific circumstances (getting started, doing stateless, using IB, etc.) 
  * The source is Howtos in OpenOffice (odt) format 
  * Converted to pdf 
  * Pdf's are shipped in the rpms and put on the web site 

## Changing Material and User-Created Material

  * Documentation that will change frequently and usually end users (i.e. not only developers) will participate in creating/updating. Examples include: FAQs, Wish List/Suggestions, Database of Users, etc. 
  * The source should be in this wiki. This makes it easy for any xCAT user to participate. 

## Developer Info

  * Info the xCAT developers need to share, for example: architecture, designs, instructions on writing plugins, or where documentation should go&nbsp;:) 
  * The source should be in this wiki. 

## New Documentation Page - In Progress

  * [XCAT_Doc_Test_Page] 
  * [XCAT_Documentation] 
  * [Editing_and_Downloading_xCAT_Documentation]
